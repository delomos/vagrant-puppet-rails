Vagrant & Puppet for Rails
==========================

A Vagrant configuration that automates the setup of a development environment
for Rails applications (pretty much based on what we use for [geleyi](https://github.com/geleyi) development).

Originally based on [@zaiste](https://github.com/zaiste/vagrant-puppet-rails.git)

It is based on Ubuntu 12.04 and it contains:

* MySQL
* RVM
* ruby-1.9.3-p385
* Passenger
* Imagemagick
